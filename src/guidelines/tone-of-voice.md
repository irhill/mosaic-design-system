    <p>Some slang is really obvious. I, a Devonian, do not blink twice when I hear someone call a woodlouse a “chickypig”. But, I am fully aware that me using that word in the company of someone not from the fertile south would be met with confusion. This is the kind of confusion we want to avoid in our products - using a term for something that is not universally applicable. It also adds to the professional tone of voice - we would not call an invalid URL a “dead link” for example.
However, some slang is sneaky. Sometimes, we go our whole lives knowing a word, without realising that it is actually a slang word. This is really difficult to “learn” how to avoid: if you do not know something is slang, you are not going to question it. Here are a couple of applicable examples:

\
•	**Phone support** - this is slang. “Phone” is not a verb. Well, it is. Sort of. It is in the dictionary and most people would know what you mean, but it is a widely-used informal word. This is an example where we are less worried about the loss of meaning, and are more worried about the impression its usage gives. The “correct” words are “telephone” or “call”. It would be much better to say “Call support” for this example.\

•	**Click the button** - another sneaky slang word. “Click” comes from the sound the mouse button makes when you press it - also, it is not a very inclusive term, what if someone is using a tablet, or keyboard controls? Really, this should be “select/press the button”. \

There is not an easy answer for this one, and mostly this will come down to other people spotting your mistakes and correcting them. Most people have a gauge of what language is informal and formal, and this generally comes from an innate sense of what is slang and what is not - so, in best practice, if something feels “too informal”, double check it and ask someone else to take a look.
