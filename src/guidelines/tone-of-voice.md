    body: "## Introduction


      This guide is designed to provide guidance on how copy should be
      written in the absence of a specifically provided message. On this tab,
      you will find the outlines for our products' **voice** and **tone** – a
      consistent style of messaging across our product suite. Use it as a
      playbook when you're writing copy in the products, and let it serve as
      inspiration to keep things consistent.

      \r

      This is **not** a guide on how to write an e-mail to a customer -
      this guide should purely be used for messaging within one of our products.
      Our “brand” identity is similar to the identity we have within the
      products, but they are not identical.


      \r

      ### What's the difference between voice and tone?


      **Voice** and **Tone** are two very similar concepts, and are
      intrinsically linked. There are some subtle differences, though.

      \r

      The **Voice** of a products are what it says. Much like you have
      your own way of putting things, Mosaic also has its own way of putting
      things. It's the difference between saying \"Hi\", and saying
      \"Salutations\". \"Indeed\" or \"Agreed\". \"Woke\" or \"Socially
      conscious\".\ 

      \r

      The **Tone** of our product is similar to the **Voice**, but there
      are some key differences. You have your own personal voice, and your voice
      doesn't change – but, depending on the situation, your tone will change.
      Speaking to a close family member will definitely be different to speaking
      to a colleague (I hope). It also changes depending on the situation at
      hand – your tone will immediately change in an emergency. The same goes
      for a product.\r

      ## The Voice of Mosaic


      Our voice is **human** but **professional**. We don’t want to treat
      our users like unfamiliar strangers and bark orders at them, but being too
      casual is just as bad. Our products saying: “Ah, saved that for you mate,
      no problem!” comes across as far too casual, but equally, “You must save
      this form.” is incredibly unfriendly. Users of Mosaic products should
      enjoy the experience, feel welcome, and have a **human** interaction – and
      also feel confident that their business needs are being treated with care
      and due diligence. Our products are expert solutions from a trusted
      source. We aren't just professionals: we are the professionals.

      \r

      But… What does this actually mean? When writing copy, you should
      strive to make it…

      * **Focused**


      We play an important role in our users' work. The user has come to
      us to solve a problem, and we chose our words carefully to do that
      quickly, and efficiently. We simplify things as much as possible, and
      don't waste time over-complicating things that simply don't need it.


      * **Genuine**


      Our users are people with a need, not clients. We don't have to keep
      them at arm's length, or maintain a business-like persona, or treat every
      interaction as a transaction. We're not looking for validation or seeking
      to impress. Our products have a collaborative relationship with our users
      – do away with pretence and get on with the job at hand. We don't worry
      about looking smart or keeping up appearances – we get to the point and
      say what we mean.


      * **Insightful**


      Our users are the experts, but so are we. Our products should
      inspire confidence in our users – we know what we're doing. Language
      should be appropriate for the task at hand, especially if when it comes to
      sector-specific knowledge, and it should show the users that they can
      trust us to do the job right. Be confident. Be assertive. Make it clear we
      know what we're doing. But never be aggressive or smug.


      <hr>


      ## The Tone of Mosaic


      Mosaic's tone is largely **friendly** and **encouraging**. We know
      that our products are used in hectic and important work environments, so
      we strive to put the user at ease. We use an everyday conversational tone
      in our products to achieve this. We are helpful, encouraging, and are
      there to support the user in every step of the way.


      * **Encouraging**


      Not all of our users are confident with tech. Nor will they always
      be 100% certain about how to complete a job. Some might even have no idea
      what they're looking for. That's fine – we're here to show them, and
      reassure them they're on the right track. Our tone reassures the user, and
      encourages them to make decisions with confidence. We might even
      occasionally pat them on the back for a job well done.\ 


      * **Approachable**


      Users should never feel alienated by our products. The language
      should be simple to understand, and everything should always be clear. We
      shouldn't worry them, or admonish them for doing something a wrong. Our
      products should guide them down the right path with a gentle hand, and
      encourage them to feel relaxed and at ease.



      * **Personable**



      Finally, our voice is friendly. Our products are a collaborator, not
      a service. Our relationship is not business-to-business, it's
      person-to-person. A user should never feel like they are interacting with
      a machine, they should instead feel like they're working on a project with
      a co-worker.

      ## Finding Our Voice


      Okay, now you know what our voice is. It's **friendly**, but it's
      **professional**. Our voice inspires confidence, but feels like a member
      of a team. How can you be both professional and provide a genuine
      connection? Read on to find a few pointers to help you achieve our tone of
      voice.\r

      If you ever aren't sure, you are encouraged to contact the UX
      Copywriter:\r

      Achieving a **professional**, **approachable**, and **friendly**
      tone of voice can be done in a few different ways:\r


      ### Be efficient, but don't cut corners\r

      * **Use full sentences**\r

      * **Do not use slang** \r

      * **Treat the user's time with respect**\r


      Avoid the usage of “lazy” language in all instances. This includes
      things like slang and turns of phrase. Slang and
      [idioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiom) may shorten the message you
      need to deliver, but it will come across as sloppy and lacking in
      professionalism. Copy in our products should always be complete sentences,
      where possible, and use proper English. \r

      This is a difficult habit to break, and I am sure you will smile
      once or twice while reading this document when you notice I have not
      followed my own advice - but that is because it is hard to avoid. We
      naturally write in our own tone of voice, even when being professional,
      and the vast majority of people use slang all the time and \"don't speak
      proper English\". The most annoying part? It's normally grammatically
      correct, and most word processors will not pick it up reliably. The
      easiest way of making sure you do not do this is getting somebody else to
      look over your copy before publishing it.\r

      \    <span class=\"mcc-accordion__label\">Obviously I'm not going to
      use slang! ...Right?</span>

      \  <div class=\"mcc-accordion__body\">

      \    <p>Some slang is really obvious. I, a Devonian, do not blink
      twice when I hear someone call a woodlouse a “chickypig”. But, I am fully
      aware that me using that word in the company of someone not from the
      fertile south would be met with confusion. This is the kind of confusion
      we want to avoid in our products - using a term for something that is not
      universally applicable. It also adds to the professional tone of voice -
      we would not call an invalid URL a “dead link” for example.

      However, some slang is sneaky. Sometimes, we go our whole lives
      knowing a word, without realising that it is actually a slang word. This
      is really difficult to “learn” how to avoid: if you do not know something
      is slang, you are not going to question it. Here are a couple of
      applicable examples:


      \\

      *\t**Phone support** - this is slang. “Phone” is not a verb. Well,
      it is. Sort of. It is in the dictionary and most people would know what
      you mean, but it is a widely-used informal word. This is an example where
      we are less worried about the loss of meaning, and are more worried about
      the impression its usage gives. The “correct” words are “telephone” or
      “call”. It would be much better to say “Call support” for this example.\\


      *\t**Click the button** - another sneaky slang word. “Click” comes
      from the sound the mouse button makes when you press it - also, it is not
      a very inclusive term, what if someone is using a tablet, or keyboard
      controls? Really, this should be “select/press the button”. \\


      There is not an easy answer for this one, and mostly this will come
      down to other people spotting your mistakes and correcting them. Most
      people have a gauge of what language is informal and formal, and this
      generally comes from an innate sense of what is slang and what is not -
      so, in best practice, if something feels “too informal”, double check it
      and ask someone else to take a look.

      \  <summary>

      \    <p>In short, no. This style guide is not going to be an A-Z of
      how to write proper English. Language is expressive, nuanced, and not
      standardised. Hence, why we have a **style guide**, not a ruleset. What I
      think of as ‘correct’, others will disagree with. There are basics, sure,
      but the scope is far too huge for me to cover here. Throughout, I will be
      giving some common misconceptions and easy mistakes, but in all likelihood
      your grammar is not going to be perfect…\r

      and that is fine! Anyone that tells you they have perfect grammar is
      lying or trying far harder than they need to be. I definitely make
      mistakes. Sure, perfect grammar makes us look super fancy and really
      professional… But, the English language evolves. Perfect grammar is not a
      requirement in the 21st century, and it can be quite easily argued that
      what people think of as “good grammar” is outdated. A lot of the time,
      “good grammar” makes reading more difficult, unless you know grammar
      really well. We have a diverse range of users who respond differently to
      levels of reading complexity, and honestly: I prefer something being
      understandable to it being correct. Semi-colons are confusing, they stick
      out. Oxford commas are technically correct, but people look at them and
      smile to themselves because they think they have spotted a mistake. Nobody
      really knows (or cares) if you should use “whom” instead of “who”. We want
      the meaning to be clear - “good grammar” comes second to that. In
      addition, being overly formal and having perfect grammar is going to make
      the products feel unapproachable and inhuman.\r

      Controversial opinion, I know, especially from a copywriter, but our
      goal here is to make language accessible, understandable, consistent, and
      readable. For the most part you do not need to worry about grammar beyond
      the basics. And, get ready for a phrase you will hear a lot: **you should
      get somebody to double-check your copy**. Any huge grammar mistakes can
      and will be easily rectified.\r


      </p>

      However – keep in mind the user's time is their most valuable asset.
      Writing wonderfully beautiful prose with nary a mistake in our products is
      all well and good – but don't overdo it. Be clear, straightforward, and
      don't waffle. Write your system message, then see if you can cut the word
      count in half without losing meaning or sentence structure. It's a hard
      skill to master, but definitely possible.


      \r

      ### **Mind your P’s and Q’s**


      \r

      Our products should be polite to the users - a simple “please” or
      “thank you” adds a personality to the products, and will go a long way to
      helping the user feel their time is valued. It is a small thing that adds
      a lot of value to copy.\r


      * **Be polite**

      * **Appreciate the user**

      * **Be careful of structure**


      Whenever a user is asked to perform an action in a long-form
      message, something that is longer than 3 or 4 words, then we should
      include “Please” in the sentence. This is appropriate for things that are
      outside a user’s normal workflow and not immediately obvious - “press
      submit” doesn't require a please, but “Your changes haven't been saved
      yet. Please press the save button before leaving the page.” should. This
      can lead to some dodgy sentence structures, so refer to the expandable
      note below for guidance. \r

      Similarly - we should thank a user for their time! When appropriate.
      Thanking them for every single step they take within our products will get
      very stale very quickly. A “thank you” should be reserved for actions
      outside of a common workflow, or when the product has been “given”
      something by the user. For example, after a user sends a bug report or
      submits a form, they should be thanked. \r
