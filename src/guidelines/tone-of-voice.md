    body: "## Introduction


      This guide is designed to provide guidance on how copy should be
      written in the absence of a specifically provided message. On this tab,
      you will find the outlines for our products' **voice** and **tone** – a
      consistent style of messaging across our product suite. Use it as a
      playbook when you're writing copy in the products, and let it serve as
      inspiration to keep things consistent.

      \r

      This is **not** a guide on how to write an e-mail to a customer -
      this guide should purely be used for messaging within one of our products.
      Our “brand” identity is similar to the identity we have within the
      products, but they are not identical.

      ### What's the difference between voice and tone?


      **Voice** and **Tone** are two very similar concepts, and are
      intrinsically linked. There are some subtle differences, though.

      \r

      The **Voice** of a products are what it says. Much like you have
      your own way of putting things, Mosaic also has its own way of putting
      things. It's the difference between saying \"Hi\", and saying
      \"Salutations\". \"Indeed\" or \"Agreed\". \"Woke\" or \"Socially
      conscious\".\ 

      \r

      The **Tone** of our product is similar to the **Voice**, but there
      are some key differences. You have your own personal voice, and your voice
      doesn't change – but, depending on the situation, your tone will change.
      Speaking to a close family member will definitely be different to speaking
      to a colleague (I hope). It also changes depending on the situation at
      hand – your tone will immediately change in an emergency. The same goes
      for a product.\r

      ## The Voice of Mosaic


      Our voice is **human** but **professional**. We don’t want to treat
      our users like unfamiliar strangers and bark orders at them, but being too
      casual is just as bad. Our products saying: “Ah, saved that for you mate,
      no problem!” comes across as far too casual, but equally, “You must save
      this form.” is incredibly unfriendly. Users of Mosaic products should
      enjoy the experience, feel welcome, and have a **human** interaction – and
      also feel confident that their business needs are being treated with care
      and due diligence. Our products are expert solutions from a trusted
      source. We aren't just professionals: we are the professionals.

      \r

      But… What does this actually mean? When writing copy, you should
      strive to make it…

      * **Focused**


      We play an important role in our users' work. The user has come to
      us to solve a problem, and we chose our words carefully to do that
      quickly, and efficiently. We simplify things as much as possible, and
      don't waste time over-complicating things that simply don't need it.


      * **Genuine**


      Our users are people with a need, not clients. We don't have to keep
      them at arm's length, or maintain a business-like persona, or treat every
      interaction as a transaction. We're not looking for validation or seeking
      to impress. Our products have a collaborative relationship with our users
      – do away with pretence and get on with the job at hand. We don't worry
      about looking smart or keeping up appearances – we get to the point and
      say what we mean.


      * **Insightful**


      Our users are the experts, but so are we. Our products should
      inspire confidence in our users – we know what we're doing. Language
      should be appropriate for the task at hand, especially if when it comes to
      sector-specific knowledge, and it should show the users that they can
      trust us to do the job right. Be confident. Be assertive. Make it clear we
      know what we're doing. But never be aggressive or smug.


      <hr>


      ## The Tone of Mosaic


      Mosaic's tone is largely **friendly** and **encouraging**. We know
      that our products are used in hectic and important work environments, so
      we strive to put the user at ease. We use an everyday conversational tone
      in our products to achieve this. We are helpful, encouraging, and are
      there to support the user in every step of the way.


      * **Encouraging**


      Not all of our users are confident with tech. Nor will they always
      be 100% certain about how to complete a job. Some might even have no idea
      what they're looking for. That's fine – we're here to show them, and
      reassure them they're on the right track. Our tone reassures the user, and
      encourages them to make decisions with confidence. We might even
      occasionally pat them on the back for a job well done.\ 


      * **Approachable**


      Users should never feel alienated by our products. The language
      should be simple to understand, and everything should always be clear. We
      shouldn't worry them, or admonish them for doing something a wrong. Our
      products should guide them down the right path with a gentle hand, and
      encourage them to feel relaxed and at ease.



      * **Personable**



      Finally, our voice is friendly. Our products are a collaborator, not
      a service. Our relationship is not business-to-business, it's
      person-to-person. A user should never feel like they are interacting with
      a machine, they should instead feel like they're working on a project with
      a co-worker.

    <p>Some slang is really obvious. I, a Devonian, do not blink twice when I hear someone call a woodlouse a “chickypig”. But, I am fully aware that me using that word in the company of someone not from the fertile south would be met with confusion. This is the kind of confusion we want to avoid in our products - using a term for something that is not universally applicable. It also adds to the professional tone of voice - we would not call an invalid URL a “dead link” for example.
However, some slang is sneaky. Sometimes, we go our whole lives knowing a word, without realising that it is actually a slang word. This is really difficult to “learn” how to avoid: if you do not know something is slang, you are not going to question it. Here are a couple of applicable examples:

\
•	**Phone support** - this is slang. “Phone” is not a verb. Well, it is. Sort of. It is in the dictionary and most people would know what you mean, but it is a widely-used informal word. This is an example where we are less worried about the loss of meaning, and are more worried about the impression its usage gives. The “correct” words are “telephone” or “call”. It would be much better to say “Call support” for this example.\

•	**Click the button** - another sneaky slang word. “Click” comes from the sound the mouse button makes when you press it - also, it is not a very inclusive term, what if someone is using a tablet, or keyboard controls? Really, this should be “select/press the button”. \

There is not an easy answer for this one, and mostly this will come down to other people spotting your mistakes and correcting them. Most people have a gauge of what language is informal and formal, and this generally comes from an innate sense of what is slang and what is not - so, in best practice, if something feels “too informal”, double check it and ask someone else to take a look.
