## Summary

Mosaic is Advanced's Design System, Component Library and content library for accessibility and brand guidelines. It is increasingly in use across the Advanced product set, with a view to open source in the near future for partner and third party adoption. The need for a more complete and robust design system came about from the creation of MyWorkplace, Advanced's platform-oriented product that aims to bring together disparate user journeys from multiple applications into one "pane of glass". In the pages of this site you will find all you need to successfully become consistent with not only MyWorkplace but other Advanced applications as well, to create the more cohesive product experience possible.
